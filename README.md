## ✨ Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```console
bundle add them-server
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```console
gem install them-server
```

### 🔒 Secure Installation

<details>
  <summary>For Medium or High Security Installations</summary>

This gem is cryptographically signed, and has verifiable [SHA-256 and SHA-512][💎SHA_checksums] checksums by
[stone_checksums][💎stone_checksums]. Be sure the gem you install hasn’t been tampered with
by following the instructions below.

Add my public key (if you haven’t already, expires 2045-04-29) as a trusted certificate:

```console
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/galtzo-floss/certs/main/pboling.pem)
```

You only need to do that once. Then proceed to install with:

```console
gem install them-server -P HighSecurity
```

The `HighSecurity` trust profile will verify signed gems, and not allow the installation of unsigned dependencies.

If you want to up your security game full-time:

```console
bundle config set --global trust-policy MediumSecurity
```

`MediumSecurity` instead of `HighSecurity` is necessary if not all the gems you use are signed.

NOTE: Be prepared to track down certs for signed gems and add them the same way you added mine.

</details>

## ⚙️ Configuration

## 🔧 Basic Usage

Run a single server locally

```bash
# Install deps
bundle install

# Migrate and (optionally) seed
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed   # adds localhost peers for demo: 9292, 9393

# Start the app
bundle exec rackup -p 2300 -E development --host 0.0.0.0
```

Browse or manage

- List gems in root: http://localhost:2300/
- Download scoped or root gems via GET as implemented in Phase 1
- Admin UI: http://localhost:2300/admin (HTML)
  - Toggle peers via the UI; JSON endpoints also available:
    - GET /admin/known_servers
    - POST /admin/known_servers/toggle (body: {base_url, subscribed})
  - Metrics: GET /admin/federation/metrics

Federation basics

- Announce yourself to a peer (signed):

```bash
# my_base_url can be provided via ENV FEDERATION_BASE_URL too
bundle exec rake federation:announce['http://peer.example']
```

- Subscribe to a peer (signed):

```bash
bundle exec rake federation:subscribe['http://peer.example']
```

- Broadcast a stubbed gem record to all subscribed peers:

```bash
# Temporarily enables FEDERATION_BROADCAST=1; does not modify your real gems
bundle exec rake federation:broadcast_stub['demo','0.1.0','scope/subscope']
```

Two-server local demo (no containers)

```bash
# This starts two rack servers on :9292 and :9393 with separate DBs, wires them via federation,
# and prints their known server lists at the end.
bin/demo_federation.sh
```

Container demo (docker-compose)

```bash
# Build and spin up two servers and a small wiring helper
docker compose up --build

# After it settles you can inspect from the host:
curl http://localhost:9292/admin/known_servers | jq .
curl http://localhost:9393/admin/known_servers | jq .
```

Environment controls

- GEM_SERVER_DB: path to the SQLite DB (default: config/db/them_server.db). Set to run multiple instances side-by-side.
- FEDERATION_BASE_URL: the base URL this server advertises in federation payloads.
- FEDERATION_BROADCAST: set to "1" to broadcast new gem pushes to subscribed peers.
- FEDERATION_PRIVATE_KEY_B64/FEDERATION_PUBLIC_KEY_B64: optional Ed25519 keypair to use a stable identity.

## 🦷 FLOSS Funding

While galtzo-floss tools are free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding.
Raising a monthly budget of... "dollars" would make the project more sustainable.

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors! We also offer a
wide array of funding channels to account for your preferences
(although currently [Open Collective][🖇osc] is our preferred funding platform).

**If you're working in a company that's making significant use of galtzo-floss tools we'd
appreciate it if you suggest to your company to become a galtzo-floss sponsor.**

You can support the development of galtzo-floss tools via
[GitHub Sponsors][🖇sponsor],
[Liberapay][⛳liberapay],
[PayPal][🖇paypal],
[Open Collective][🖇osc]
and [Tidelift][🏙️entsup-tidelift].

### Another way to support open-source

> How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.<br/>
> —Anne Frank

I’m driven by a passion to foster a thriving open-source community – a space where people can tackle complex problems, no matter how small. Revitalizing libraries that have fallen into disrepair, and building new libraries focused on solving real-world challenges, are my passions — totaling 79 hours of FLOSS coding over just the past seven days, a pretty regular week for me. I was recently affected by layoffs, and the tech jobs market is unwelcoming. I’m reaching out here because your support would significantly aid my efforts to provide for my family, and my farm (11 🐔 chickens, 2 🐶 dogs, 3 🐰 rabbits, 8 🐈‍ cats).

If you work at a company that uses my work, please encourage them to support me as a corporate sponsor. My work on gems you use might show up in `bundle fund`.

I’m developing a new library, [floss_funding][🖇floss-funding-gem], designed to empower open-source developers like myself to get paid for the work we do, in a sustainable way. Please give it a look.

## 📌 Versioning

This Library adheres to [![Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver-img]][📌semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs.
Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility.
Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions.

> dropping support for a platform is both obviously and objectively a breaking change <br/>
> —Jordan Harband ([@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb), maintainer of SemVer) [in SemVer issue 716][📌semver-breaking]

I understand that policy doesn't work universally ("exceptions to every rule!"),
but it is the policy here.
As such, in many cases it is good to specify a dependency on this library using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("them-server", "~> 1.0")
```

<details>
<summary>📌 Is "Platform Support" part of the public API? More details inside.</summary>

SemVer should, IMO, but doesn't explicitly, say that dropping support for specific Platforms
is a _breaking change_ to an API.
It is obvious to many, but not all, and since the spec is silent, the bike shedding is endless.

## 🤑 A request for help

Maintainers have teeth and need to pay their dentists.
After getting laid off in an RIF in March and filled with many dozens of rejections,
I'm now spending ~60+ hours a week building open source tools.
I'm hoping to be able to pay for my kids' health insurance this month,
so if you value the work I am doing, I need your support.
Please consider sponsoring me or the project.

## 🌐 Federation (Phase 2)

This server now supports minimal, secure federation to discover peers, subscribe to updates, push gem metadata, and validate scopes/gems across instances.

- Endpoints (all JSON unless noted):
  - POST /federation/announce
    - Body: { base_url, public_key_b64, signed_at }
    - Headers: X-Signature: base64(Ed25519.sign(canonical(request)))
    - Upserts the peer into known_servers and returns { status, public_key_b64 }.
  - POST /federation/subscribe
    - Body: { base_url, signed_at }
    - Headers: X-Signature signed by the announcing peer’s key
    - Marks the peer as subscribed.
  - POST /federation/push
    - Body: { from_base_url, name, version, scope_path[], digest_sha256, record_sig_b64, signed_at }
    - Headers: X-Signature signed by the sender; record_sig_b64 is a separate signature over: name\nversion\nscope_path_joined\ndigest_sha256
    - Stores a federated gem record after verifying signatures.
  - GET /federation/validate/scope/{scope-path}
    - Returns { exists, scope_path, signed_at, record_sig_b64, public_key_b64 }.
  - GET /federation/validate/gem/{scope-path}/{gem}
    - Returns { exists, source: local|federated, name, version, scope*path, digest_sha256, record_sig_b64, public_key_b64, origin*\* }.

- Canonical request signing
  - canonical = [METHOD, PATH, signed_at, sha256_hex(payload)].join("\n")
  - X-Signature = base64(Ed25519.sign(canonical))

- Environment
  - FEDERATION_BROADCAST=1
    - If set, successful gem pushes broadcast to subscribed peers.
  - FEDERATION_BASE_URL
    - Base URL used in federation push payloads.
  - FEDERATION_PUBLIC_KEY_B64, FEDERATION_PRIVATE_KEY_B64
    - Optional explicit Ed25519 keypair for this server; otherwise a process-local ephemeral keypair is generated.

- Storage
  - known_servers: peers (base_url, public_key_b64, subscribed, timestamps)
